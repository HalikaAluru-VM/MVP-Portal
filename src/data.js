It promises efficiencies through automated code generation, intelligent reviews, enhanced test coverage, and advanced problem-solving.Harnessing GenAI's benefits requires deliberate skill development and adaptation across our engineering teams. Towards this end, we are implementing a comprehensive learning framework. This includes structured workshops, GenAI Labs for hands-on experience, and practice with insurance-specific scenarios.GenAI Fest is our new initiative to equip all our engineers with GenAI skills, recognizing its fundamental role in software development for insurance. Practice projects with GenAI Coaches will help engineers apply these skills before using them on client deliverables. This support also ensures that engineers learn from collective experience.Our commitment to leading this transformation will enhance value for clients and create impactful roles for our engineers. Mastery of GenAI is crucial for winning and retaining clients. We urge each of you to embrace this initiative with commitment and enthusiasm – The time to develop these critical skills is NOW – our success as individuals and organization depends on it."

This is not business as usual. This is about preparing ourselves to lead the change, not follow it.Our customer has made it clear: Gen AI adoption is a priority. And when they finalize their tool of choice, I want us to be the team that’s ready from Day 1—not catching up, but driving outcomes from the very beginning. That readiness starts now—with each of you, with every session, and with how open we are to thinking differently.Let me say this clearly: technology will keep evolving. Tools will come and go. But what sets us apart is you. Your curiosity, your adaptability, your hunger to challenge the status quo—these are the real differentiators. This is your chance to look beyond conventional boundaries, question old patterns, and reimagine what’s possible.So I urge each of you—lean in. Participate whole-heartedly. Embrace the discomfort of new learning.

They have also set up an AI Center of Excellence for reviewing, approving, and governing the adoption of AI across the enterprise in a thoughtful and secure manner.As their largest and strategic vendor partner, it’s imperative that we stay ahead of the AI curve to guide our clients like ERIE and others in quickly but safely adopting AI technologies to solve their business and technology problems. Being their largest partner, it is key for us to look at means and ways to improve the productivity and efficiency of our employees, so that we can work faster and smarter.I am glad that our Technology Solution Centers (TSCs) are taking multiple broad steps to enhance the AI awareness and skills of our employees. However, these programs will bear fruit and do so quickly only with your active, focused involvement and enthusiastic adoption of the lessons and exposure these programs provide. More than the benefit we intend to provide for our clients and VM as an organization, these programs will position each of you for an improved career path and help you to successfully surf this giant technology wave.
